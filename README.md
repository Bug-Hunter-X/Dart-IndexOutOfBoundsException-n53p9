# Dart IndexOutOfBoundsException Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart programming: the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access an element in a list using an invalid index, resulting in this exception.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution by adding checks to ensure the index is within the valid range before accessing the element. This example highlights the importance of careful index handling in Dart.
